    \caption{A measure for evaluating the approximation performance of the 1-WL colors by the best performing GNN. The GNN was trained on the PROTEINS dataset, and the measure was applied to 10 randomly selected graphs from the GNN's test set. The average normalized error for the entire test set is: 0.4912.}
